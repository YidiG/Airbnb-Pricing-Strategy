# Airbnb-Pricing-Strategy

The objective of this project is to enhance Airbnb's competitiveness and profitability by addressing two significant challenges. Firstly, we aim to tackle the closing gap in pricing between Airbnb and traditional hotels. Secondly, we aim to streamline the process of designating new "Superhosts," making it more efficient.

To achieve these goals, we constructed an optimized pricing model and automated the Superhost designation process. By doing so, we intend to empower Airbnb hosts and the corporate team to be more competitive in the market and ultimately enhance profitability.

The dataset used in this project comprises 16,035 listing records from the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). It encompasses 75 detailed features that play a crucial role in our analysis and model development.

For our analysis and predictive modeling, we employed a range of machine learning techniques, including Unsupervised Learning, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting. These algorithms were chosen to leverage the dataset effectively and make data-driven decisions to address the challenges at hand.

Overall, this project showcases the potential of machine learning and data analysis in devising effective pricing strategies and improving operational efficiency for Airbnb, leading to greater competitiveness and enhanced profitability in the market.
